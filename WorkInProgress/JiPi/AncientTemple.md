Ancient Temple
==================

Based on '_[Ancient Temple](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4lX3Rj)_' by [Kali](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/kali) and porting by [JiPi](Profiles/JiPi.md).

When converting this shadertoy, there is a major difference between WebGL and DCTL.
In the original, the superstructures and the ball are given a grain. This is not implemented under DCTL. I was able to identify the following line that is used for the calculation:

``
es + = exp (-1.2 / abs (l-pl));
``

I tried to find a workaround through various measures, such as

```
#define _e 2.71828182846

...

es + = pow_cf (_e / 2.0, -1.2 / abs (l-pl));
```

I haven't been able to get anywhere near a grain. My guess is that for some reason the sampling over the entire frame is lost via the functions for this feature.
