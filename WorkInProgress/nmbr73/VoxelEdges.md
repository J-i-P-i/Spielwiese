Voxel Edges
===========

Based on '_[Voxel Edges](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4dfGzs)_' by [iq](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/iq) and ported by [nmbr73](../Profiles/nmbr73.md). This Shader does still not render as I would expect it - therefore I did not yet spent time on compability (at least it compiles and runs on macOS Metal and OpenCL).
