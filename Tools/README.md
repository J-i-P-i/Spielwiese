# Tools

## Install

* Drag and drop `Tools/Setup.lua` from your working copy on your DaFusions working area
* Check the 'Integrate the repository Tools into Script menu'  to - guess what - integrate the repository Tools into the Script menu
* Do this at your very own risk!
* Have fun and ignore the other 'Install Manually' sections in this readme file

In particular if you are on Windows: don't forget to uncheck all options and to the save the configuration before moving or deleting your Shadertoys working copy!

## Install Manually
### Install 'Tools' manually by copying the files

* Copy the folder `Shadertoys` from `Shadertoys/Tools/Scripts/Comp/`to your `Scripts/Comp/` folder.
* Copy the folder `Shadertoys` from `Shadertoys/Tools/Modules/Lua/`to your `Modules/Lua` folder.<br />
* Create a file `Shadertoys/~user_config.lua` in your `Modules/Lua/` folder.<br />
* Edit that `~user_config.lua` file to contain the following text with `<PATHTOYOURREPO>`the path to your working copy of the repositoy:
```lua
local user_config = { pathToRepository = '<PATHTOYOURREPO>/' }
return user_config
```


### Install 'Tools' manually using Symlinks on a Mac

cd into your working copy ... in my case I cloned the repository into â€˜~/Projects/':

```
cd ~/Projects/Shadertoys/
````

Persist the information on where to find the repository ...
```
REPO=`pwd`

echo "local user_config = { pathToRepository = '$REPO/' }\nreturn user_config" \
 > $REPO/Tools/Modules/Lua/Shadertoys/\~user_config.lua

BMD=~/Library/Application\ Support/Blackmagic\ Design
```

... and in the same shell set symbolic links for Fusion to point into your working copy:

```
cd "$BMD/Fusion/Modules/Lua"
ln -s "$REPO/Tools/Modules/Lua/Shadertoys" Shadertoys
cd "$BMD/Fusion/Scripts/Comp"
ln -s "$REPO/Tools/Scripts/Comp/Shadertoys" Shadertoys
````

... resp. do so for Resolve:
```
cd "$BMD/DaVinci Resolve/Fusion/Modules/Lua"
ln -s "$REPO/Tools/Modules/Lua/Shadertoys" Shadertoys
cd "$BMD/DaVinci Resolve/Fusion/Scripts/Comp"
ln -s "$REPO/Tools/Scripts/Comp/Shadertoys" Shadertoys
````
