RainbowSlices.fuse
==================

Based on '_[Rainbow Slices](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XdsGD4)_' by [fizzer](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/fizzer) and ported by [nmbr73](../Profiles/nmbr73.md). This is a quick and dirty convesion that will definiely need some rework. But it turned out to be very easy to tranlate so far and as this version already runs on Metal I wanted to share the itermediate result.
