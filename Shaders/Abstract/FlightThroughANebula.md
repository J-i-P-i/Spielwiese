# FlightThroughANebula.fuse :new:

Based on '_[Flight Through A Nebula V3](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tsK3Rd)_' by [Delvar](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/Delvar) and ported by [JiPi](../Profiles/JiPi.md).

In the original, `Texelfetch()` and GreyNoise-Volumes are used. But even without this, this shader is successful.
