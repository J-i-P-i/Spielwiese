Flight through a colorful ball grid

[![BumpyReflectingBalls](BumpyReflectingBalls.png)](https://github.com/nmbr73/Shadertoys/blob/main/AbstractShader/BumpyReflectingBalls.fuse)

The surface of the balls can be influenced by a texture, so you can achieve very nice flowing appearances. The grid can be enlarged, the color distribution can be changed and you can "manually" fly through the grid if you switch off the "autopilot" with the Stop button and use the three levers Rotation 1 to 3 :-)

Tested with Cuda, OpenCl and Metal.

Have fun playing
