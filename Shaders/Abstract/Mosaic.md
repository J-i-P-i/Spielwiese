# Mosaic.fuse :new:

Based on '_[Mosaic](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XtySRc)_' by [Darksecond](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/Darksecond) and ported by [JiPi](../Profiles/JiPi.md).

Mosaics have always fascinated me. I know there are very good standard tools out there that are probably better than this shader, but the conversion still appealed to me.
In addition to the mosaic size and the joint width, the joint color can also be changed.
