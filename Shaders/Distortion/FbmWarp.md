# FbmWarp.fuse :new:

Based on '_[Fbm Warp](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ttGyzG)_' by [hanker](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/hanker) and ported by [JiPi](../Profiles/JiPi.md).

This shader obviously takes advantage of a trick in WebGL that doesn't quite work that way in DCTL. A small adjustment made at least the principle function possible. If the result looks a little different, it is not worse.
