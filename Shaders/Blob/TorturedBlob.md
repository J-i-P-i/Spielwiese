TorturedBlob.fuse
================

Based on '_[TorturedBlob](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MlKGDK)_' by [roywig](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/roywig) and ported by [JiPi](../Profiles/JiPi.md). A classic blob with a lot of deformations. Tested under Cuda and OpenCL, test under metal is pending

A nice example of the use of the mat3

```
 //**** mat3 ****
 typedef struct
  {
  float3 r0, r1, r2;
  } mat3;
```
Have fun
