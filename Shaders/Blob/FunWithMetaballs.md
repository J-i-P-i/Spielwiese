FunWithMetaballs.fuse
================

Based on '_[FunWithMetaballs](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MlyXWV)_' by [fwilliams](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/fwilliams) and ported by [JiPi](../Profiles/JiPi.md). This Shader has four Blobs, three Lights, Ambientlight and Background. All colors can be changed, the size of the blobs and their fading, too. I hope enough opportunities to play.
